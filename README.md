# latreutes

Desktop application for browsing and connecting to ZeroTier and Sargassum networks.

Named after [_Latreutes fucorum_](https://www.itis.gov/servlet/SingleRpt/SingleRpt?search_topic=TSN&search_value=96870#null) (the slender Sargassum shrimp), a crustacean inhabitant of the Sargasso Sea, this cross-platform application is a prototype for a more user-friendly way of discovering and joining ZeroTier networks, by allowing networks to be joined via a DNS-based domain name.
